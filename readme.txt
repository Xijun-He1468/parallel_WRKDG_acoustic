This code is developed by Xijun He for the 3D acoustic wave-field simulation using WRKDG mthod on unstructured meshes. It corresponds to the example in section 6.2 of the manuscript "A parallel weighted Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method for 3D wave-filed modelling in isotropic and anisotropic media on unstructured meshes" (Authors: Xijun He, Dinghui Yang, Chujun Qiu, Yanji Zhou, Xiao Ma).  The output file  v1_03 (for Tecplot 360 drawing) is used to generate Fig.13;  The output file wave1.txt (for waveform plot)  is used to generate Fig.14.
